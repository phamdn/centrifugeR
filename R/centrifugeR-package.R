#' centrifugeR: Non-Trivial Balance of Centrifuge Rotors
#'
#' Find the numbers of tubes that can be loaded in centrifuge rotors in a single
#' operation and show how to balance these tubes in cases of equal or unequal
#' masses. Refer to Pham (2020) \url{https://doi.org/10.31224/osf.io/4xs38} for more information
#' on package functionality.

#' @section Guidelines: centrifugeR helps obtain the perfect centrifuge balance.
#'   First, call \code{\link{rotorCheck}} to know how many tubes can be loaded
#'   into the rotor in a single operation. Use \code{\link{rotorEqual}} to
#'   balance these tubes given that they have the same mass. If their masses are
#'   not the same, use \code{\link{rotorUnequal}} to know which tubes must be
#'   increased in mass before they can be loaded. Also, call
#'   \code{\link{rotorVerify}} to verify pre-existing tube configurations and
#'   \code{\link{rotorSpeed}} if RPM/RCF conversion is needed.
